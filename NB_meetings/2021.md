## Meeting summary: 


### Attendees:

-  Inbal Levi
-  Ran Regev
-  Andrei Zissu
-  Michael Peeri
-  Amir Kirsh
-  Dvir Yitachaki
-  Tamir Bahar

### Minutes:

We had an open discussion on the following topics:
* Reflection at compile time (for the compiler) / runtime (for the program)
* Serialization & Deserialization
* Decorators design pattern, and python's decorators
* Reflection overhead (at compilation time for compile-time reflection, at compilation time, size and run-time for run-time reflection)
* How to create a facility which follows the rule of "Don't pay for what you don't use".
* Code generation internal to the language (such as in: C++'s template metaprogramming) vs. external to the language (such as in: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/, https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)

#### Action items
* Research decorators syntex and implementations for next meeting (https://wg21.link/p1887 may be useful here) - feel free to join Andrei on this topic.
* Please consider for the next meeting: 
  * Reflection use-cases.
  * Possible facilities and syntex.
  * Possible overhead.
  * Reasoning for having the feature in the library vs. in the language.  
  * Reasoning for having the feature in the C++ library or language vs. external to the language.
